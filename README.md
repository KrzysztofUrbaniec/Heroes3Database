Being a huge fan (but certainly not an expert) of Heroes of Might & Magic 3, I'd like to learn more about units, heroes and artifacts it offers and make an attempt to formulate a gameplay strategies, based on their unique properties. This project consisted of three stages: scraping hero, unit and artifact data from Wikipedia page dedicated to the game, saving extracted data into a MySQL database and utilizing this data to answer a couple of questions, that can provide insights for better decision making within the game. 

Personal goals related to the project:
- learn how to interact with MySQL databases via Python
- face unit testing for the first time
- get the idea and learn the basics of webscraping
